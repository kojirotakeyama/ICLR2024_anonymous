- Code (for both evaluation and training) and trained models
- Shell script for the evaluation

### Instructions 

1. Download the material from the link above.
2. "pip install -r requirement.txt" to install the libraries necessar for the code
4. To get the evaluation result, run "evaluate.sh". Then the evaluation result will be created as csv files.
5. If you need to try training the models, run "training_vrlocomotion2.py" in each model folder.

### Note
- We are planning to publish our dataset and codes on a website after we organized them.
